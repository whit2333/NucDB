 Well this is the email that I was looking for....

Zein Eddine and I were in his office about a month ago and I
remembered that Herbert had calculated d2n at various values
or Q^2.  I finally found this email in the files I downloaded
from my linux machine.

As you can see the values in my talk are only for Q^2= 4GeV^2
and without the update that Herbert put in which it might take
some thought to dig up. I have some more emails between us and
Xiaochao on this. But this seems to be the last we did on d2n in 2004.
Regarding the modification and the values below as compared to my
table I in my talk I'll try to find out from some emails between us
and Xiaocho.

Best, Leonard

Dear Xiaochao,

the e-mail system at Siegen University is not working
properly, so I use my MIT account to answer.

First, here are the data for d2 as they come out the
computer:

Q^2=3GeV^2
 D2 (p) =   0.00486181576
 D2 (n) =  -0.00184613729

Q^2=5GeV^2
 D2 (p) =   0.00435609369
 D2 (n) =  -0.00166798373

Q^2=10GeV^2
 D2 (p) =   0.00381175587
 D2 (n) =  -0.00145107071

Q^2=100GeV^2
 D2 (p) =   0.00271389848
 D2 (n) =  -0.00103804698

These do *not* include the update for g_1. When
they are included D2(p)\approx 0.01 and
D2(n) \approx 0.005. However, w/o updating g_2
these numbers have some twist-2 contribution
and are thus inconsitent.

Concerning Balitsky et al. Note that there is an
erratum PLB318 (93) 648 according to which the
sign of D2(n) should be changed. That would then
be consistent with Song's quotation when multiplied
by -3. But shouldn't the factor be +3? That's what
we use.

Ehrnsperger & Sch"afer do not compute g_2 at all.
When comparing their model calculation for g_1 to data
they use two assumptions a) g_2 = g_2^{WW} (purely
twist-2) and b) g_2=0. So I assume that the results
quoted by E155x are from b).

A (1-x)^\alpha dependence is often adopted to model the
large x behavior of structure functions (they must
vanish at x=1). To some extend quark counting rules
can be used to motivate certain values for \alpha.
However, I suspect that E155x took \alpha=1 and
\alpha=2 just as a choice.

I hope these lines arrive and are helpful.

Best regards,
Herbert.

Q^2=3D5GeV^2
 D2 (p) =3D   0.00435609369

Q^2=3D10GeV^2
 D2 (p) =3D   0.00381175587
 D2 (n) =3D  -0.00145107071

Q^2=3D100GeV^2
 D2 (p) =3D   0.00271389848
 D2 (n) =3D  -0.00103804698

These do *not* include the update for g_1. When
they are included D2(p)\approx 0.01 and=20

When comparing their model calculation for g_1 to data

A (1-x)^\alpha dependence is often adopted to model the

can be used to motivate certain values for \alpha.
However, I suspect that E155x took \alpha=3D1 and=20
\alpha=3D2 just as a choice.
