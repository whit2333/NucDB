>> Description 

   This directory contains the inclusive unpolarized pion production cross section
   for electron beam energies of E = 4.74 GeV (4-pass) and 5.89 GeV (5-pass), at a 
   scattering angle of 45 deg.  The target was 3He.  

>> Directories 

   Negative: pi- cross sections 
   Positive: pi+ cross sections 

>> File Format 

   < E' (MeV) > < xs (pb/MeV/sr) > < stat error (pb/MeV/sr) > 

   where E' is the scattered electron energy.
