        <h3>Welcome to the NucDB web site.</h3>

        <p>
        NucDB is an attempt to easily interface and search experimental data, add data to the database, and make pretty plots. 
        It is utilizes the <a href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a> libraries. 
        </p>


        <h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>
	This project begain as an attempt to consolidate the world data on spin structure functions and make nice plots of them. Naturally the unpolarized structure functions were added, then virtual compton scattering asymmetries... etc. 
	</p>

	<p>
        Most of the data is from unpolarized and polarized DIS experiments but ideally this will be expanded to include many other experiments. The Durham HEP data project is a great source of data but not the only source.
	</p>


        <p> Written in C++, NucDB takes advantage object oriented programming in a way that generalizes data and how we plot it.
        There is one singleton manager class, <b>NucDBManager</b>, which is used to facilitate searching, adding, and retrieving data.
        For now, there are major two branches of data stored:  experimental results and calculation results.  
        Each <b>NucDBExperiment</b> is added to the database, which is just an instance of a <b>NucDBDatabase</b> that is saved to a root file, taking full advantage of the ROOT object streaming.
        An experiment is given a unique name for identification and a title which is used in generating plots and legends.
        </p>
        <p>
        A  <b>NucDBMeasurement</b> is added to an experiment. <b>NucDBDataPoints</b> are added to measurements in order to build up the data.
        Each <b>NucDBDataPoint</b> has a few data members which are instances of <b>NucDBErrorBar</b> representing statistical and systematic errors. 
        There are also a lot of useful methods for getting and setting these values.    
        </p>
        <p>
        Because measurments are often given in kinematic bins or variables that are not quite same there is a generalized variable called <b>NucDBBinnedVariable</b>.
        It represents one variable and has a width, average, and everything else you would expect. 
        Each <b>NucDBBinnedVariable</b> is add to the data point. The class <b>NucDBDependentVariable</b> derives from <b>NucDBBinnedVariable</b> and represents
        a variable that is not given, but can be calculated. Concrete implmentations of this class assign a function which relates one or more variables to the calculated dependent variable.
        For example, given a measurement like F2p in bins of x and Q2, one can easily plot all data as function of W using the concrete implementation <b>NucDBInvariantMassDV</b>. In this way we can easily combine data from many experiments together on one plot.      
        </p>

        <h3> Examples </h3>
 <p> Here are some plots that were easily created using NucDB. </p>
